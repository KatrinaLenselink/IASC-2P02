## Bio
I am in my second year at Brock university, majoring in Interactive Arts and Science. My specific area of specialization is in the research field of Media Archaeology. This specialization consists of analyzing past media in order to understand present and emerging digital technologies in the media today. Two projects I have in my portfolio reflect my research focus as they both concentrate on the integration of the past into current technologies. The collaborative project in my portfolio focused on analyzing the media tool “The Map of Early Modern London”. This tool was used to showcase what early London would have looked like back in that era. Our group chose to analyze this tool as we were interested in looking back at the past through a modern digital view. Secondly, my research presentation analyzed the impact that a fictional technology from an old television show has on the development of current technologies today. In the future I would be interested in how we could utilize current digital media, such as AR and VR, to explore historic moments in time. For example, implementing virtual reality in history exhibits in a museum to allow visitors to fully immerse themselves in the past and gain a better understanding.

This research presentation focused on the idea of media archaeology. The technology from the past that I chose to research was the tricorder from the 1966 television show Star Trek: The Original Series. I chose to analyze a fictional technology in order to see how fictional media has had an impact on the technologies that we produce today. I believe that the introduction of the tricorder in our media has had a positive impact on the development of current technology as it has given us extreme ideas to strive for and improve upon. I began by researching the basics about the device and then watched episodes of the show that contained the tricorder. This allowed me to see the technology being used and helped me to fully understand the importance of the device in the show. Through this research, I discovered that there were two version of the tricorder: general and medical. The general tricorder was used to scan new planets environments in order to collect data about the area. The medical tricorder was used to scan people and was able to give instant and accurate information about the patient’s health and diagnose health problems. The significance of this technology if we were able to accurately recreate this in today’s society would be that we could diagnose patients in their home without the need for extensive and intrusive testing, such as blood tests, as well as lowering the cost significantly. If everyone was able to carry around a medical tricorder, I believe that it would help decrease overcrowded hospitals and people would be able to know immediately if they had a sickness that needed to be treated. 

After receiving feedback on my initial presentation, I did more research on technology that is similar to the original tricorder. I now realize how our ideas of today can be heavily influenced by the past. Even if we haven’t completely recreated the original technology yet, there are still many variations and different ways of creating a similar item. For example, the Apple Watch and Fitbit are two technologies that have some similar functions to the tricorder, such as monitoring heart rate and blood pressure. In the updated version of my presentation, I included research on the Apple watch technology as you can see [here](https://github.com/KatrinaLenselink/IASC-2P02/commit/f7760d73a093217f957bad398124c4a114af6b75). Also, I discussed the abilities of the Fitbit (shown [here](https://github.com/KatrinaLenselink/IASC-2P02/commit/576e3ca2d94b805fb30bbd1211e09b21d73a50f9)) and compared both technologies to the tricorder device which you can see [here](https://github.com/KatrinaLenselink/IASC-2P02/commit/4d5881e7124051b6c94269c30bf82f1e853c0f53). Lastly, I further explored the idea of the adjacent possible and considered a hypothetical situation in accordance with the tricorder technology, which is shown [here](https://github.com/KatrinaLenselink/IASC-2P02/commit/94bb800bbfbe82555dc5c441224d6870f514eb70). I added these slides to further explore the modern-day technology and to show how the original technology can be remodeled and expanded upon. My previous research was mainly focused on technologies that were created for the sole purpose of trying to recreate the tricorder. However, now I realize that I should have also looked at simple technology that was accomplishing a few of the tricorder abilities without explicitly meaning to. This research has expanded my view of health monitoring technology from the extreme, futuristic versions, to the simplistic but functional technology that has been created.

## Collaborative Project 

For this project, my group chose to use the digital online tool called “The Map of Early Modern London (MoEML)”. This tool was an online, interactive map that depicted what London would have looked like in the 1600s. The research question we chose to explore was about the popularity levels of Christianity during a certain time period. Our three areas of focus were on the number of churches, number of chapels, and number of Christian streets. Our findings indicated a fair amount of Christian symbolism throughout the map of London. We used this information to conclude that Christianity was fairly popular during this time as it affected the naming of streets and construction of buildings.
